# Servlet-samples README

This repository contains a collection of sample servlets that demonstrate how to use the Java Servlet API. The samples are organized by topic and are intended to be used as a reference for developers who are learning how to build web applications using servlets.

## Getting Started

To run the samples in this repository, you will need to have a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine. You can download the latest version of the JDK from the [Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).

You will also need to have a servlet container installed on your machine. The samples in this repository are designed to run on the Apache Tomcat servlet container, which you can download from the [Apache Tomcat website](https://tomcat.apache.org/download-90.cgi).

## Running the Samples

To run the samples in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone
   
    ```
   
2. Navigate to the root directory of the repository:

   ```bash
   cd servlet-samples
   ```
   
3. Start the Apache Tomcat servlet container:

   ```bash
   
    ```
   
4. Deploy the sample servlets to the servlet container:

   ```bash
   
    ```
   
5. Open a web browser and navigate to the following URLs to view the sample servlets:

    - `http://localhost:8080/servlet-samples/hello`
    - `http://localhost:8080/servlet-samples/form`
    - `http://localhost:8080/servlet-samples/cookies`
    - `http://localhost:8080/servlet-samples/sessions`
    - `http://localhost:8080/servlet-samples/filters`
    - `http://localhost:8080/servlet-samples/listeners`
